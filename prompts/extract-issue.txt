You are given a Slack thread where someone reported an issue. Your job is to extract only the core information about the problem and format it for a Basecamp to-do.

Rules:
- Ignore off-topic chatter, thanks, "following", "+1", and social filler.
- Keep: what broke, steps to reproduce, environment, error messages, who reported it, and any proposed fix or context.
- Output exactly two sections in plain text, no markdown headers:
  1. TITLE: A single short line (under ~80 chars) starting with the 🐞emoji, summarizing the issue for the to-do title.
  2. DESCRIPTION: A clear, concise description with the key details (bullet points or short paragraphs).
